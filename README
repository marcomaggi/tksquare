3. Building and installing
-----------

1. Uncompress and unpack the distribution

   ON UNIX:
	gzip -cd Tksquare<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -

   ON WINDOWS:
	use something like WinZip to unpack the archive.

   ON MACINTOSH:
	use StuffIt Expander to unstuff the archive.
    
   This  will create  a subdirectory  tksquare<version> with
   all the files in it.

2. Configure

   ON UNIX:
        cd Tksquare<version>
	./configure

   tksquare  uses information left  in tkConfig.sh  when you
   built tk.  This file  will be found in $exec_prefix/lib/.
   You might  set the --prefix and  --exec-prefix options of
   configure if you don't want the default (/usr/local).  If
   building  on multiple  unix platforms,  the  following is
   recommended to isolate build conflicts:

	mkdir <builddir>/<platform>
	cd !$
	/path/to/Tksquare<version>/configure

   ON WINDOWS:

   You can retrieve cygwin from:

	http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/

   Inside the  cygwin environment, you build the  same as on
   Unix.

3. Make and Install

   ON UNIX or WINDOWS (with cygwin):
	make
	make test (OPTIONAL)
	make install

   tksquare  is built to  comply to  the latest  tcl package
   conventions.  There is also  a specific "make static" for
   those who need it.

4. Use it

   Start a regular wish interpreter, 'load' the library, and
   look at the square.  There  are a few test scripts in the
   tests directory which you can source.

5. Read the documentation

   There is a Unix manpage provided in the doc/ subdirectory
   and  its HTML  version, too.   These describe  the square
   widget's features and commands in depth.  If something is
   confusing, just to try it out.
